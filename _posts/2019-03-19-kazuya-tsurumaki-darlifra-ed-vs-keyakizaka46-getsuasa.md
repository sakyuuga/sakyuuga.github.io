First, let's take a look at Keyakizaka46's music video "Getsuyoubi no asa, Skirt wo Kirareta" which is directed by Kazuma Ikeda.

And then let's take a look at Kazuma Tsurumaki's takes on "Getsuyoubi no Asa". In this music video (or ending animation) he took a pen-name Tanabe Rika, a pun of Keyakizaka46's member Watanabe Rika, which is hardly surprising because he's been reported as a big sakamichi series fan, including Nogizaka46.
