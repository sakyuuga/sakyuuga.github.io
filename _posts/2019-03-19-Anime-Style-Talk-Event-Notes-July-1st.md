<b>Foreword</b>

Please note that I'm not a professional translator, Japanese and English aren't my first language, so it might contain some translation errors. I <i>did</i> re-arrange the original notes to make it easier to read, I also added some additional infos for the reader to better understand the context. 

I know this is a crappy translation, the grammar might felt awkward and I added a lot of my own interpretations from the original notes (they were a series of tweet, which summarized what have been said in this event). 

Thank you for reading.

<font color="color:#7eb0e6;"><b>Let's talk about Yutaka Nakamura</b></font><br/>


<font color="#87CEFA"><b>Inoue:</b></font> Nakamura-san's animation is really good, just by watching his animation really lifts up my mood. His _sakuga MADs_ are always overflowing with such pleasure.  

<font color="#87CEFA"><b>Inoue:</b></font> His animation in Sword of the Stranger always brings so much joy to me, it's a must-see scene for animators or people who are aiming to be animator. 

<font color="#87CEFA"><b>Oguro:</b></font> Nakamura always reads the air, doesn't he?  He's surely like to play around with the storyboards but he still does it at the scope where it is allowed.

<font color=""><b>Note: Nakamura animated the climax battle in Sword of Stranger</b></font>

<font color="#87CEFA"><b>Inoue:</b></font> Speaking of Nakamura-san, I noticed that in his <a href="https://www.sakugabooru.com/post?tags=yutaka_nakamura+character_acting+">character acting animation</a>, even a simple movement looks so amazing. I'm confident that my skill isn't inferior compared to him, but I have to admit that his creative power (the animation in his action) is outstanding. He possesses such an amazing skill and enthusiasm when drawing, that's what makes him amazing. 

<font color="#87CEFA"><b>Honda:</b></font> I noticed that recently there's a sudden surge of young animators who want to achieve what Nakamura-san has been doing (jaw-dropping action) from the get-go. I think it's important to remind them that super animators like Nakamura-san also started from obscurity by doing simple character acting. There are many youngster who neglected this basic stage.  

<font color="color:#7eb0e6;"><b>About Inoue's animation characteristic</b></font><br/>


<font color="#87CEFA"><b>Inoue:</b></font> I don't draw things that's so out of place, or you can say <i>strange</i>. I'm capable of drawing animation in such a way that I (and other people) desired.
<font color="#87CEFA"><b>Oguro:</b></font>  Well, that's a bit cool. Wait...isn't it too cool? To be able to meet the direction's demand and even exceeds their expectation. Also you don't need any correction, do you?
<font color="#87CEFA"><b>Inoue:</b></font>  Well, you can say that to be able to meet the direction's demand is also my aesthetic sense. Also, during the production of Ghost in the Shell, people at I.G said "look, only Inoue-san's <i>genga</i> that aren't corrected". 

<font color="color:#7eb0e6;"><b>Gu Gu Ganmo, one of Inoue's earliest work and where did his inspiration come from</b></font><br/>


<font color="#87CEFA"><b>Oguro:</b></font> "You really did well on Ganmo, not only your animation was able to meet production's demand, you also played with the movement and delivered cool action too."
<font color="#87CEFA"><b>Inoue:</b></font>  "I wasn't particularly thinking about direction nor the audience at the time, I just was doing whatever I wanted. It was the era where animators' characteristic were displayed directly through what they draw. They didn't draw with such a mind like 'what if it will be checked by other people (animation supervisors)'. For example in Urusei Yatsura, there were several people who followed in Yoshinori Kanada-san's footsteps and their animation really stood out."
<font color="#87CEFA"><b>Honda:</b></font>  "I decided to enter animation industry after I saw Ganmo. Inoue-san's <a href="https://www.sakugabooru.com/post?tags=gu_gu_ganmo+toshiyuki_inoue+">animation</a> were just different from other people's drawings and easy to spot."

<i><b>Inoue's part in episode 7, roller coast scene.</b></i>

<font color="#87CEFA"><b>Oguro:</b></font>  That scene was really impressive.
<font color="#87CEFA"><b>Inoue:</b></font>  At the time I received a strong influence from Takashi Nakamura-san. The way he draws body's form and limbs is just so cool, and I hadn't seen something like that before.
<font color="#87CEFA"><b>Inoue:</b></font>  Speaking of Takashi Nakamura-san, rather than AKIRA I always liked his Gold Lightan and Urashiman better after all. His solo episode on Gold Lightan episode 41 (<i>大魔神の涙</i>) was really good. Although there were many production restrictions (to save money) during his solo episodes, like several cuts weren't used in photography process.

<br/>

<font color="#87CEFA"><b>Honda:</b></font>  I have to confess that actually I've never watched that episode before.
<font color="#87CEFA"><b>Inoue:</b></font>  Then prepare yourself for a slap on the wrist.
 <i>Oguro's trivia: "Although Sushio-san really likes Takashi Nakamura's AKIRA, he has never watched Urashiman."


<font color="color:#7eb0e6;"><b>From Ganmo to friendship with Hiroyuki Kitakubo</b></font><br/>


<font color="#87CEFA"><b>Inoue:</b></font>  After the broadcast of Ganmo's first episode, I was asked directly by <a href="https://www18.atwiki.jp/sakuga/pages/816.html">Hiroyuki Kitakubo</a>-san to show me the <i>genga </i>for <a href="https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/21369">my scene.</a> Since then we stayed in touch with each other and I got the chance to see many <i>genga</i>from another studio's (and freelance) animators, such as in Urusei Yatsura. Actually I traded my Ganmo <i>genga</i> with Kitakubo's collection, it was <a href="https://www18.atwiki.jp/sakuga/pages/55.html">Yasuomi Umetsu</a>-san's 'Stop!! Hibari-kun!' <i>genga</i>.

<i>Note</i>: during the production of Urusei Yatsura, Kitakubo also did some KA for 'Stop!! Hibari-kun!' episode 9 and 15, which had Umetsu as animation supervisor and key animator in those episodes.
 
<font color="color:#7eb0e6;"><b>About Cream Lemon Part 4</b></font><br/>


<font color="#87CEFA"><b>Inoue:</b></font> After Ganmo, we became really close and then Kitakubo-san invited me to his Pop Chaser episode."
<i>Note: Inoue drew the H scene in the first half. [NSFW Warning]</i>

<i>Cream Lemon Part 4: POP♥CHASER was released on March 13, 1985. It was Hiroyuki Kitakubo's first directorial debut, just when he was still 21 years old. He was credited under pen name Dai Sakura, with him providing the scenario, storyboard, direction, animation supervision, and character design (along with Yuuji Moriyama). Kitakubo's personal connection was truly integral role for this OVA, they were brought from various places, and not to mention that all of them were using pen names. You can say they were the memers of their generation. </i>

<font color="#87CEFA"><b>Inoue:</b></font> It's necessary to make the individuals movement different when they are making out, and there's bed sheet too. I kinda want to compliment myself for figuring that out."
