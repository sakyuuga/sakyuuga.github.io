##Foreword
Please note that I'm not a professional translator, Japanese and English aren't my first language, so it might contain some translation errors. I did re-arrange the original notes to make it easier to read, I also added some additional infos for the reader to better understand the context. 

I knew this isÂ a crappy translation, the grammar might felt awkward and I added a lot of my own interpretations from the origina; notes (they were a series of tweet, which summarized what have been said in this event). 

Thank you for reading.
