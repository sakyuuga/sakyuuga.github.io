<b>Foreword</b>

Please note that I'm not a professional translator, Japanese and English aren't my first language, so it might contain some translation errors. I <i>did</i> re-arrange the original notes to make it easier to read, I also added some additional infos for the reader to better understand the context. 

I know this isÂ a crappy translation, the grammar might felt awkward and I added a lot of my own interpretations from the original notes (they were a series of tweet, which summarized what have been said in this event). 

Thank you for reading.

<b>Let's talk about Yutaka Nakamura</b>

<font color="#87CEFA"><b>Inoue:</b></font> Nakamura-san's animation is really good, just by watching his animation really lifts up my mood. His _sakuga MADs_ are always overflowing with such pleasure.  

<font color="#87CEFA"><b>Inoue:</b></font> His animation in Sword of the Stranger always brings so much joy to me, it's a must-see scene for animators or people who are aiming to be animator. 

<font color="#87CEFA"><b>Oguro:</b></font> Nakamura always reads the air, doesn't he?  He's surely like to play around with the storyboards but he still does it at the scope where it is allowed.

<font color=""><b>Note: Nakamura animated the climax battle in Sword of Stranger</b></font>

<font color="#87CEFA"><b>Inoue:</b></font> "Speaking of Nakamura-san, I noticed that in his <a href="https://www.sakugabooru.com/post?tags=yutaka_nakamura+character_acting+">character acting animation</a>, even a simple movement looks so amazing. I'm confidence that my skill isn't inferior compared to him, but I have to admit that his creative power (the animation in his action) is outstanding. He possesses such an amazing skill and enthusiasm when drawing, that's what makes him amazing.
