<center><a href="http://sakyuuga.github.io"><b>sakyuuga memo</b></a> is a blog focused on animation production, specifically about Japanese animation/anime.</center>

You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/sakyuuga">twitter</a>, I used to translate interviews or event reports that related to animation production or sakuga and posted them on wordpress, but sadly my account got suspended so I have to make a new blog. I'll try to restore the content of my old blog as soon as possible.
